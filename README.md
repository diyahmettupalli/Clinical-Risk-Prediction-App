# Clinical Risk Prediction Application
This is an Android application for clinicians to assess a patientâ€™s risk for post-discharge VTE (venous thromboembolism) after having undergone Ventral Hernia Surgery.

This app was developed in collaboration with a surgeon at UCSF; the risk percent calculation came from a logistic regression equation developed through lots of sample patient data.
